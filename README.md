## Plan

Strategic frameworks — both written guides and interactive tools in the Control Plane — to identify, justify, and prioritize agentic AI use cases before you build. Use them in order (Assess → Design → Identify → Justify) or jump to the one you need.

Four interactive frameworks, each persisted to DynamoDB and accessible from the Plan section of the platform interface.

| Framework | When to use | What it produces |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Maturity Assessment** | New to AI agents — establish a baseline before investing | Score across 5 dimensions (Data, Infrastructure, Org, Governance, Strategy) with 25+ indicators, gap analysis, and an L1–L5 maturity rating |
| **Operating Model** | Have a maturity score and need to choose how to organize delivery | Pick a Target Operating Model — Centralized CoE / Hub-and-Spoke / Federated — by scoring 7 dimensions (Strategy, Governance, Org, People, Tech, Process, Ecosystem) across 21 questions, with investment guidance per pattern |
| **Use Case Prioritization** | Have multiple competing ideas and need to sequence them | Rank use cases against the AWS Enterprise AI Scoring Model (25 weighted sub-criteria across value, feasibility, risk, readiness, alignment, and cost) with Go/Conditional/No-Go gates |
| **Business Cases** | Need executive buy-in or budget approval for a specific opportunity | CFO-grade DCF model — NPV, IRR, payback, ROI — with an 8-category risk scorecard, ramp-up curves, and Go/Review/Reject verdicts |
| **Organization Design** | Have chosen your Operating Model and need to stand up the team | Concrete org chart derived from the TOM pick — roles, squads, reporting lines, RACI matrix across Build / Secure / Operate / Govern, and a headcount ramp with hiring priorities so Plan hands Build a team, not just a strategy |

### Written guidance

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Use Case Discovery Guide**](plan/UseCaseGuidance.md) | 8-step framework for enterprise leaders to identify high-value agentic AI use cases — covers bounded autonomy, measurable outcomes, and governance across industries |

> More strategic planning resources coming soon — persona-specific playbooks (CEO, CIO, CTO, CFO, CRO, CDO) and industry-specific adoption guides.

## Platform

The AVA Control Plane is a web-based management layer for deploying and operating agent applications on AWS.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [**Backend**](platform/docs/architecture/platform-architecture.md) | FastAPI API — template catalog, packaging engine, deployment orchestration, test runner |
| [**Frontend**](platform/control_plane/frontend/README.md) | React + TypeScript UI — browse use cases, deploy with one click, view logs, test agents |
| [**Infrastructure**](platform/control_plane/infrastructure/README.md) | Terraform modules — ECS, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, CloudFront, CodeBuild |

### Deployment Paths

The Control Plane offers two ways to deploy any use case, backed by the same CodeBuild pipeline:

| Path | Best For | How It Works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Quick Deploy (S3)** | Business users, standard deployments | Backend packages the use case source from the template catalog into a ZIP, uploads to S3, and triggers Step Functions. No Git knowledge needed. |
| **Deploy from Git (CodeCommit)** | Developers, custom forks, team collaboration | User selects a pre-seeded CodeCommit repo from the UI. CodeBuild clones the repo and deploys. Push code to the repo to customize before deploying. |

Git-path repos are pre-seeded from the FSI Foundry registry by a one-time script (`scripts/seed-codecommit.sh init`). Users don't need to create repos manually.

[**Deploy the Control Plane &#8594;**](platform/docs/architecture/platform-architecture.md)

---

## Build

Three ways to build agentic systems on AWS, ordered from most opinionated to most composable. Mirrors the **Build** section in the Control Plane.

### Applications

Pre-built FSI workflows, forkable references, reusable templates, and AI-generated apps from a plain-language brief — four paths from idea to production.

#### FSI Foundry

34 multi-agent POC implementations spanning 7 FSI domains — all built on one shared foundation of infrastructure and backend code.

- **Direct Amazon Bedrock AgentCore deployment** — simple and quick
- **Two framework implementations per use case** — LangGraph/LangChain and Strands Agents SDK
- **Shared foundations** — adapters, base classes, Terraform modules, Docker configs, agent registry
- **Per-use-case frontend UI** — Each use case has a dedicated React frontend deployed via CloudFront

After deploy, hit **Launch in Console** to federate (STS `AssumeRole` + sigv4 sign-in URL) directly into the agent's AWS Console with the right operator role — no manual role-switching, no copy-paste credentials.

### Capabilities

Composable building blocks agents reach for at runtime — governed once, reused across every application and autonomous agent. Browse them from the **Capabilities** section of the Control Plane. Three primitives, rolling out incrementally:

| Capability | What it is | Examples | Status |
|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Knowledge** | Everything agents *read from* | Data Lake (Glue + Athena + S3/Iceberg), RDS/JDBC connections, Bedrock Knowledge Bases (vector + hybrid retrieval), document stores | **Available** (Data Lake); Knowledge Base coming soon |
| **Prompts** | Reusable, versioned templates | Prompt Optimization (Bedrock AdvPO), system prompts, response templates, evaluation rubrics, guardrail clauses | **Available** (Prompt Optimization); Prompt Library coming soon |
| **Tools** | Everything agents *call* | MCP Gateway, Code Interpreter, Web Browser, API Connector, Notifications, custom Lambda/OpenAPI tools | Coming Soon |

Each primitive is registered once with access control, lineage, and audit trail, then attached to agents at deploy time. Update a prompt or re-index a knowledge base without redeploying the agent.

---

### Harness

A managed agent-loop scaffold wrapping AWS Bedrock AgentCore Harness — pick a model, paste a system prompt, attach tools, and hit **Test** to stream the agent's response in the Control Plane. Live SSE streaming with a per-session console so prompt authors can iterate without re-deploying. Deployed harnesses can be published to Registry → Agents (`recordType=AGENT`, tag `Kind=agent`).

### Memory

Managed memory stores for agents — configurable extraction strategies (semantic, episodic, summary) backed by Bedrock AgentCore Memory. Attach a memory namespace to any agent at deploy time; the agent reads/writes across turns without you managing the underlying store.

---

### Registry

The **AVA** namespace on AWS Agent Registry — the in-account discovery layer every AVA resource writes to. Five typed record kinds share one control-plane surface, one approval flow, and one audit trail. Curated catalogs on each subpage let users deploy well-known items in one click.

| Record kind | AWS Agent Registry mapping | UI page | Curated catalog |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Agents** | `recordType=AGENT` + tag `Kind=agent` | `/registry/agents` | 4 curated (AWS DevOps Agent, AWS Security Agent, Kiro, Sample FSI KYC Agent) |
| **MCP Servers** | `recordType=MCP` (descriptor `mcpServer` v2025-12-11) | `/mcp` | Well-known MCP server catalog |
| **A2A Servers** | `recordType=AGENT` + tag `Kind=a2a` (descriptor `a2aAgentCard` v0.3) | `/a2a` | AWS, Google, Anthropic reference A2A peers |
| **Skills** | `recordType=SKILL` (descriptor `agentSkillsDefinition` v0.1.0) | `/registry/skills` | 6 canonical skills (evaluation rubrics, KYC triage, extraction, guardrail templates) |
| **Custom Resources** | `recordType=CUSTOM` (free-form descriptor) | `/registry/custom-resources` | — (register any resource with free-form JSON metadata) |

**Auto-publish on successful deploy.** Every Foundry / reference app that deploys through the Control Plane becomes an **AGENT** record in the AVA registry automatically. The wire-up is a new additive Terraform module (`modules/deployment_success_hook`): an EventBridge rule on the deployment Step Function's `SUCCEEDED` events fires a Python Lambda that reads the deployment from DDB and publishes it as `recordType=AGENT` with tag `Source=foundry-deploy` and `DeploymentId=<uuid>`. The Step Function itself is untouched. Idempotent — a re-run skips if a record with the same `DeploymentId` tag exists.

**Approval-aware create flow.** Every registration consults the Approval Policy Engine before writing. If a policy matches with `mode=auto_approve`, the record is created + submitted + approved in one transaction. If `mode=require_approval`, the record lands as `PENDING_APPROVAL` and an Approval Queue row is opened. If `mode=deny`, the API returns 403 with the denying policy's reason. All state transitions bridge AWS's async lifecycle: CREATING → DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED with per-step polling so no record ever gets stuck in DRAFT.

---

### Catalog

A unified inventory of every resource across all Build subsections — Applications, Frontier Agents, Custom Agents, Harness, Memory, MCP Servers, A2A Agents, AgentCore Runtimes, and Templates — with a single **Registry** column that shows whether each is Active / Pending / Deprecated / Not in Registry. Filter by section, by registry state, or by name. The one place to answer "what's actually running, and is it approved?".

---

## Secure

Safety controls every deployed agent passes through — built on Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and extended with platform-level policy management, federated identity, and an executive-grade approval workflow.

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **LLM Gateway** | OpenAI-compatible gateway built on [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm). Deploys on ECS Fargate with Aurora PostgreSQL + ElastiCache Valkey + ALB (same shape as the Foundation Stack). Provides virtual keys per agent/team, budgets and rate limits, Bedrock Guardrails attached as a `during_call` hook, Langfuse trace emission, and full CloudWatch audit. Every agent points at one `LITELLM_BASE_URL` — Govern (FinOps + Audit) reads live data from here. | **Available** |
| **Guardrails** | Content filters (hate, insults, sexual, violence, misconduct, prompt attack), PII detection and redaction, denied topics, word filters, and contextual grounding. Manage templates from the Control Plane; attach one or more to any agent at deploy time. FSI-tuned presets provided (FSI Standard, Market Surveillance, Customer Service). | **Available** |
| **Identity** | Federate external identity providers — Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Auth0, or any generic OIDC provider — and map group claims to AVA roles. Auth Code + PKCE, discovery-URL testing, and per-provider claim mapping so enterprise SSO drops in without a Cognito rebuild. Registration routes through the Approval Queue by policy. | **Available** |
| **Policy** | AgentCore policy engine (Cedar) for fine-grained tool-access control on gateways. Attach/detach a policy engine to any use-case gateway, switch ENFORCE vs LOG_ONLY, and author allow/deny rules that the gateway enforces on every tool call (default-deny). Managed from the Control Plane Policy page. | **Available** |
| **Approval Policies** | Human-in-the-loop rules for sensitive actions — declare which `resource_kind + action` combinations require sign-off, from whom (`ADMIN` / `OPERATOR`), by when (SLA hours), and how many approvers (quorum). Eight `AVA Default` policies are seeded on backend boot covering MCP / A2A / Skills / Agents / Custom / Identity registration, Application delete, and Application deploy auto-approve. Live enforcement wired into `mcp.py`, `a2a.py`, `skills.py`, `agents.py`, `custom_resources.py`, `identity_providers.py`, and `deployments.py`; matches feed the Operate → Approval Queue. | **Available** |

---

## Operate

Five operational surfaces, one platform. Every deployed agent lands here for launch tracking, dual observability, prompt iteration, and human sign-off.

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Deployments** | Every CodeBuild + CloudFormation run kicked off from AVA — reference apps, harness updates, FSI Foundry deploys — in one queue with streamed logs, artifact URLs, and success/failure status. No jumping between AWS consoles. | **Available** |
| **AgentCore Observability** | AWS-native traces for AgentCore agents — CloudWatch GenAI Observability + X-Ray Transaction Search. Opt-in checkbox when deploying FSI Foundry use cases; once enabled, traces appear automatically in the AWS console. **Pick this for SRE / incident response — did the runtime actually receive the request?** | **Available** |
| **Langfuse Observability** | Self-hosted Langfuse v3 for application-level traces, prompt versioning, evaluations, and cost analytics. Each FSI Foundry use case auto-provisions its own Langfuse project. Embedded as an iframe in the Control Plane with auto-login. **Pick this for prompt iteration, evals, and cost analysis.** | **Available** |
| **Prompt Optimization** | Bedrock Advanced Prompt Optimization — submit a seed prompt + labeled JSONL examples; Bedrock generates candidate variants, scores each against your rubric, and returns the winner. One-click promotion to your Harness. | **Available** |
| **Approval Queue** | Live inbox of pending HITL sign-offs produced by the Approval Policy Engine. Each row shows requester, target resource, action, matched policy, and time remaining. Approve or deny inline; bulk approve/deny up to 200 rows per call. Every decision flips the corresponding AWS Agent Registry record (DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED, with lifecycle-safe fallback if the record is stuck in DRAFT). | **Available** |

Together, the two observability stacks cover the full lifecycle: AgentCore Observability shows whether the runtime received and dispatched the request; Langfuse shows what the agent's reasoning and tool calls actually did.

## Architecture

| Area | Document | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Platform** | [**Platform Architecture**](platform/docs/architecture/platform-architecture.md) | Full system design with Mermaid diagrams — frontend, backend, CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure modules, per-use-case UI deployment flow |
| **Platform** | [CI/CD Pipeline](platform/docs/architecture/cicd-pipeline.md) | Dual-source CodeBuild buildspec — Git clone / S3 unzip, Docker build, Terraform apply, UI build, S3 sync, CloudFront invalidation |
| **Platform** | [Infrastructure Scripts](platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts/README.md) | Reference for every shell and Python script used to deploy, tear down, and seed the Control Plane (deploy-full, destroy, import-existing, seed-codecommit) |
| **Registry** | Agent Registry Module (Terraform) | `platform/control_plane/infrastructure/modules/agent_registry/` — creates the AVA namespace inside AWS Agent Registry, wires `AGENT_REGISTRY_ID` into the backend ECS task environment, and exposes ARN outputs for downstream modules |
| **Registry** | Agent Registry Client (Python) | `platform/control_plane/backend/src/services/agent_registry_client.py` — shared boto3 wrapper for `agent-registry-control` used by every registry route (`mcp.py`, `a2a.py`, `skills.py`, `agents.py`, `custom_resources.py`). Handles the async CREATING → DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED lifecycle with polling; tag reads go through `ListTagsForResource` because `GetRegistryRecord` doesn't return tags |
| **Registry** | Deployment Success Hook (Terraform + Lambda) | `platform/control_plane/infrastructure/modules/deployment_success_hook/` — additive to the deployment Step Function. EventBridge rule on `aws.states` SUCCEEDED events triggers a Python Lambda that publishes the deployed application as an AGENT record in AWS Agent Registry. Idempotent (dedupes on `DeploymentId` tag). Step Function itself is untouched |
| **Approvals** | Approval Policy Engine (Python) | `platform/control_plane/backend/src/services/approval_policy_engine.py` — evaluates `evaluate(kind, resource_id, action)` against active policies with priority resolution (mode strictness → pattern specificity → role strictness). Returns a `PolicyVerdict` with mode `auto_approve` / `require_approval` / `deny` and the matched policy for audit |
| **Approvals** | Approval Policy Bootstrap (Python) | `platform/control_plane/backend/src/services/approval_policy_bootstrap.py` — seeds 8 `AVA Default` policies on backend boot (Agent / MCP / A2A / Skills / Custom / Identity registration require OPERATOR; Application delete requires ADMIN; Application deploy auto-approves) |
| **Approvals** | Approval Requests Route | `platform/control_plane/backend/src/api/routes/approval_requests.py` — Approval Queue CRUD + per-row `POST /{id}/approve|deny|cancel` + `POST /batch-approve|batch-deny` (up to 200 rows). Decision hook flips the linked AWS Agent Registry record via `set_status()` (submits-for-approval first if stuck in DRAFT) or DDB Identity Providers record |
| **FSI Foundry** | [Architecture & Deployment](applications/fsi_foundry/docs/foundations/README.md) | [Architecture Patterns](applications/fsi_foundry/docs/foundations/architecture/architecture_patterns.md) &#124; [AgentCore Design](applications/fsi_foundry/docs/foundations/architecture/architecture_agentcore.md) &#124; [Deployment Guide](applications/fsi_foundry/docs/foundations/deployment/deployment_patterns.md) |

| **AaaS** | AWS DevOps Agent | Same-account deploy of Amazon's managed DevOps Agent — Agent Space, operator role, primary-account association, optional sample Lambda for Part 2 cross-account monitoring. Available in three IaC flavors: [Terraform](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/devops/iac/terraform/README.md) &#124; [CDK](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/devops/iac/cdk/README.md) &#124; [CloudFormation](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/devops/iac/cloudformation/README.md) |
| **AaaS** | AWS Security Agent | Same-account deploy of Amazon's managed Security Agent — design review, code review, on-demand pentest. Three IaC flavors: [Terraform](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/security/iac/terraform/README.md) &#124; [CDK](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/security/iac/cdk/README.md) &#124; [CloudFormation](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/security/iac/cloudformation/README.md) |
| **AaaS** | Federated Console Launch | STS `AssumeRole` + sigv4 sign-in URL flow that lets operators jump from AVA into the deployed agent's AWS Console with the right operator role — no manual role-switching. Implemented in `backend/src/api/routes/frontier_agents.py` |
| **AaaS** | [Frontier Agents Registry](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents.json) | Catalog entry that drives the deploy UI — agent metadata, supported IaC types, parameters |
| **Observability** | [Foundation Stack (Langfuse v3)](platform/docs/templates/foundation-stack.md) | Langfuse v3 + OpenTelemetry on ECS Fargate (bundled with required networking). Deploy once per account/region; every use case auto-provisions its own Langfuse project against this foundation |
| **Observability** | AgentCore Observability | CloudWatch GenAI Observability + X-Ray Transaction Search. APPLICATION_LOGS log delivery + X-Ray trace destinations are wired into every AgentCore runtime stack at deploy time. One-time per-account prereq: enable X-Ray Transaction Search via `null_resource` in the Control Plane Terraform |
| **Govern** | Governance Aggregator | `frontend/src/components/govern/useGovernanceAggregator.ts` pulls live data from guardrails, deployments, use cases, agents, and frontier agents into a single `summary` consumed by the 8 Govern workspaces |
| **Evaluation** | Evaluation *(coming soon)* | Agent performance testing and quality benchmarks |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with [Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) (Claude models enabled)
- AWS CLI >= 2.28.9
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python >= 3.11
- Node.js >= 22
- Docker with buildx support

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/ava
cd ava

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS credentials and region
```

**Choose your path:**

The Control Plane supports two deployment modes — **local** for rapid development and testing, and **AWS** for production. Both run the same code; local uses Docker Compose while AWS uses ECS Fargate with ALB, DynamoDB, and S3.

#### Local Development (Finch / Docker Compose)

Spin up the full stack locally — backend, frontend, LLM Gateway (LiteLLM), Redis, and PostgreSQL. Uses [Finch](https://runfinch.com/) (recommended) or Docker Compose.

**Prerequisites:**
- Finch (`brew install finch && finch vm init`) or Docker with Compose v2
- Valid AWS credentials with Bedrock model access in `us-east-1`
- AWS CLI v2 (`aws configure export-credentials` support)
- The default local catalog uses Amazon Nova Lite and GLM 4.7 Flash; no Mantle key is needed.

**1. Configure environment variables**

```bash
cd platform/control_plane

# Create .env from the example template
cp .env.example .env
```

The example `.env` selects `us-east-1`. A Bedrock Mantle API key is optional,
only if you add Mantle models to the gateway yourself:

```
BEDROCK_MANTLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

**2. Export AWS credentials for the gateway container**

The LiteLLM container needs explicit AWS credentials (it cannot use the host's `credential_process`). Export them as environment variables before starting the stack:

```bash
# Export temporary credentials from your AWS profile into the current shell
export $(AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile> aws configure export-credentials --format env \
  | grep -v '^export AWS_CREDENTIAL' \
  | sed 's/^export //')
```

> **What this does:** Resolves your IAM role session (via Isengard, SSO, etc.) into `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, then exports them into your shell. The compose file picks them up via `${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:-}` interpolation. The `grep -v` strips the `AWS_CREDENTIAL_EXPIRATION` line which is not needed.
>
> **Note:** The Bedrock Mantle API key in `.env` is loaded automatically by Compose and does not expire like session tokens. Only the AWS credentials need periodic refresh.

**3. Start all services**

```bash
finch compose up --build -d
```

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | React Control Plane UI (nginx proxies `/api/` to backend) |
| Backend | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI API server |
| Gateway | http://localhost:4000 | LiteLLM proxy (OpenAI-compatible) |
| Redis | localhost:6379 | Cache + rate limiting |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 | LiteLLM key/spend storage |

**4. Verify the gateway is healthy**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-local-dev-key" \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

Check that Nova Lite and GLM 4.7 Flash are healthy. Each model also has a raw-ID
alias, so the health response may count aliases separately. The master key for local dev is `sk-local-dev-key`.

**5. Test a chat completion**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-local-dev-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Claude Haiku 4.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 50
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```

**6. View available models**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-local-dev-key" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(m['id']) for m in json.load(sys.stdin)['data']]"
```

Default models: Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-5.5 (Bedrock Mantle), GPT-5.4 (Bedrock Mantle), Amazon Nova Pro, Amazon Nova Lite, Amazon Nova Lite v2.

**Refreshing expired credentials**

AWS session tokens typically expire after 1–12 hours. When models show as unhealthy (`"The security token included in the request is invalid"`), refresh and restart the gateway:

```bash
cd platform/control_plane

export $(AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile> aws configure export-credentials --format env \
  | grep -v '^export AWS_CREDENTIAL' \
  | sed 's/^export //')

finch compose up -d gateway
```

**Stopping the stack**

```bash
finch compose down        # Stop and remove containers (preserves volumes)
finch compose down -v     # Stop, remove containers AND volumes (clean slate)
```

**Architecture notes:**
- The frontend container uses an nginx reverse proxy (`frontend/nginx.local.conf` mounted as a volume) that routes `/api/*` to the backend container — no CORS configuration needed.
- The gateway config lives at `gateway/litellm-config-local.yaml` (mounted read-only into the container). Edit it to add/remove models.
- PostgreSQL data is persisted in a named volume (`pgdata`) so virtual keys and spend data survive container restarts.

All 7 LLM Gateway tabs (Overview, Config, Models, Virtual Keys, Spend, Audit, Playground) work locally against the containerized LiteLLM proxy.

#### AWS Deployment (Production)

The Control Plane is the recommended entry point — once deployed, it can CI/CD-deploy every application including FSI Foundry use cases, reference implementations, templates, and app factory from its UI. The Foundry and reference implementation scripts remain available for standalone plug-and-play use if you'd rather skip the Control Plane.

**Recommended — deploy the Control Plane, then use its UI for everything:**

| Step                               | Command | Required? |
|------------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| 1. Deploy the Control Plane        | `cd platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts && ./deploy-full.sh` | Required |
| 2. Seed CodeCommit (enables the "Deploy from Git" path in the UI) | `cd platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts && ./seed-codecommit.sh init` | Optional — only for the Git deploy path |
| 3. Docker Hub auth (avoids docker.io rate limits when deploying the Langfuse Foundation Stack) | `cd platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts && ./setup-dockerhub-auth.sh` | Optional — only if you'll deploy the Langfuse Foundation Stack. [Instructions](platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts/README.md#setup-dockerhub-authsh) |

After step 1, sign in to the Control Plane UI to deploy any FSI Foundry use case, reference implementation, app template, or AaaS frontier agent — no further CLI work needed. Recommended next steps once you're in:

1. Deploy the **Foundation Stack** template once per account/region — it brings up Langfuse v3 so all other deployments emit traces to a single place
2. Deploy a **FSI Foundry** use case (e.g. `kyc_banking`) to see the Strands + LangGraph dual implementation, and confirm Observability is wired
3. Deploy a **Frontier Agent** (DevOps or Security) and click **Launch in Console** to verify federated sign-in
4. Open **/govern/command-center** for the platform-wide GRC view of every deployed agent

**Alternative — deploy standalone (without the Control Plane):**

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Deploy a single FSI Foundry use case from the CLI | `cd applications/fsi_foundry && ./scripts/main/deploy.sh` |
| Deploy a reference implementation from the CLI    | See [applications/reference_implementations/](applications/reference_implementations/README.md) |

> **⚠️ Model Access:** AWS accounts that have not used a legacy model in the last 30 days will receive an error when calling that model, resulting in **"Error: No Response"** in the frontends. Check the Model Catalog to select the right model.
