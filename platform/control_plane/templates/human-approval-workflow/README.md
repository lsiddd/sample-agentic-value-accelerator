# Human Approval Workflow

An agent that drafts proposed actions and pauses for human approval before execution. The response includes the proposed action and approval status, enabling external systems to approve or reject via callback endpoints.

## Pattern

Human-in-the-loop interrupt pattern. The agent analyzes a request, drafts a proposed action, and returns it with a "pending" approval status. External approval systems can then approve or reject the action. The payload includes approval endpoints for integration with notification systems (Slack, email, dashboards).
